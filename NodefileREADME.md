# Data-Visualization

Nodefile.js is for NeighborVis, a software which visualizes trends over a map via getting data from social media. The purpose of this file is to act as a compliment for the map. It comprises of a scatter chart which will tell you how many uses of the trend word are in a given day.

Notes:
- These functions use the CanvasJs library
- Graphs in Javascript seem to sort themselves; the total complexity for the program is O(n) (linear time).

Potential Plans:
- Add a feature to expand on the data visualization. By clicking on a datapoint, one can see the growth of the trend in that given day.
